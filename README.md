# Momentum-Trading-Strategy-using-Moving-Average

#### The goal for this project is to create a Momentum Trading Strategy using Moving Averages which can beat the market. 
#### Beating the Market: The goal of many trading strategies is to achieve higher returns than the market average over the same period. In this context, "beating/outperforming the market" means generating a higher return with our strategy than what we would have earned with a simple buy and hold approach.
